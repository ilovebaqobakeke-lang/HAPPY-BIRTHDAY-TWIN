  <h1>HAPPY BIRTHDAY TWIN! I LOVE U SO MUCH<3</h1>

  <p>
    Hellows my love! Cheers to 15! Ur old now eheheheh 
    This is a little smth I've been working on â€”  
    IK ITS NOT ME SINGING ITTT cuz obv I'm not a singer and idk shit abt recording songs and stoof,  
   but I think I knew a lil smth to use audio presets and make a song for u :D  
    MB IF ITS DISAPPOINTINGG but the lyrics are from the bottom of my heart and I mean it love. I love u so much,I kinda vibe w this song tho ehehehe it's such a vibe. hope u like it ;D BE HONEST THO RATE IT OUTTA 10- here are the lyrics btw:
My twinâ€¦ my one, my start,
From day one you had my heart.
Walked in class, I caught your eyes,
Fell in love, no alibis.

I waited for your text to come my way,
Too shy to speak, with too much to say.
We teased each other to hide the truth,
But love was there from the very youth.

That red dress moment, clear as flame,
I knew forever, Iâ€™d call your name.
If I had known you loved me too,
Iâ€™d waste no time to run to you.

You hate that mark, but I see art,
The thing that drew me from the start.
Hazel eyes, green in the light,
They keep me safe, they hold me tight.

From endless chats to silence now,
But love still grows, I donâ€™t know how.
Through every test, through all weâ€™ve been,
Iâ€™ll marry you, my twin.

People tried to break our chain,
But we stayed strong through all the pain.
On rugby days I pass your street,
Smile inside, knowing loveâ€™s complete.

If it were mine, Iâ€™d take you away,
Marry you young, not one more day.
Different schools, but love wonâ€™t fade,
Stronger each night, more vows are made.

Your insecurities shine to me,
Theyâ€™re the things I love endlessly.
Hazel green eyes, my safe disguise,
My forever home where true love lies.

No girl, no lie, can break this view,
My promise stands, itâ€™s only you.
Through hardships all, weâ€™ll always win,
Forever, Iâ€™ll marry you, my twin.

    Focus on em and enjoyyyy mwah &lt;3
